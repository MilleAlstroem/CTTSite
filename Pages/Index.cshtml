            <p>
                Our clinic is located near Winslow in Bucks.<br />
                We're about 10 mins from Bletchley, and 20 mins from Aylesbury.<br />
                <br />
                We offer face to face sessions from a wonderful space with a large room and three distinct areas. 
                We have comfy chairs for our talking therapy sessions, a big table and chairs for creative therapies, and a desk for Zoom calls.<br />
                <br />
                The space is owned by a personal training gym who we can highly recommend!<br />
                <br />
                We have hot drinks, comfy blankets and a library of books which you can borrow.<br />
                <br />
                We can be flexible with appointment times and days in our own cosy space.<br />

            <h2><b>WE ARE NOW OFFERING A RANGE OF THERAPIES!</b></h2>
            <p>
                We are excited to announce that we are expanding to offer alternative and complimentary therapies within Chiltern Talking Therapies.<br />
                <br />
                When you book a free 30 minute consultation, you will speak to Jennie, who will discuss whether Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (her main discipline) would be recommended for your difficulties.<br />
                <br />
                Although most people can benefit from CBT, there are some circumstances where Jennie would recommend a different type of therapy.
                For example, if bereavement is the focus of your difficulties right now, that would be Jennie's recommendations as ethically this is the right advice to give.<br />
                <br />
                However we are now able to offer alternative therapies to support a client at any stage of their therapy journey.<br />
                <br />
                We will introduce our new Associate Therapists in time, but we will now be able to offer Counselling and Art Psychotherapy services to support clients of all ages, including couples.<br />
                <br />
                Contact us for more information.<br />
