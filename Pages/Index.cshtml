                            <br />
                            <p>
                                We are excited to announce that we are expanding to offer alternative and complimentary therapies within Chiltern Talking Therapies.<br />
                                <br />
                                When you book a free 30 minute consultation, you will speak to Jennie, who will discuss whether Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (her main discipline) would be recommended for your difficulties.<br />
                                <br />
                                Although most people can benefit from CBT, there are some circumstances where Jennie would recommend a different type of therapy.
                                For example, if bereavement is the focus of your difficulties right now, that would be Jennie's recommendations as ethically this is the right advice to give.<br />
                                <br />
                                However we are now able to offer alternative therapies to support a client at any stage of their therapy journey.<br />
                                <br />
                                We will introduce our new Associate Therapists in time, but we will now be able to offer Counselling and Art Psychotherapy services to support clients of all ages, including couples.<br />
                                <br />
                                Please see our Services or Contact us for more information.<br />

A friend gave me Chiltern Therapies details and I contacted Jennie. Honestly she has helped me change my outlook on life for the better. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but she really makes me feel that no issue is too big or too small. I am not judged or laughed at and feel I can tell her anything. Jennie is so kind and I feel at such ease with her. I sometimes feel like its catching up with a friend and not talking to a professional in a suit. I am really looking forward to continuing my journey and gaining a better outlook on life."

She has provided me with so many tools that will help me going forward and has helped me put into perspective the negative thoughts I was having. She is warm, friendly and open. I would highly recommend Jennie to anyone who is looking for CBT."

Her coping strategies has been instrumental for my recovery and something I’ll continue to use for rest of my life. Throughout the duration of our sessions our interaction was over zoom call but it didn’t feel awkward in anyway and I was very comfortable."
